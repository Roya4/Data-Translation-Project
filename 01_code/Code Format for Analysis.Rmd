Memo: Explain purpose and goal: (copied and pasted from the assignment page)
- The ACME corporation is considering moving into agricultural inputs in Ghana. To get an idea of whom to target for their sales efforts they have hired you to analyze what determines agricultural profit there. They are especially interested in what effect household educational attainment and the characteristics of the local area has on profit, but if you find other results of interest, they would like to hear those as well. They have left the choice of explanatory variables and variable definitions to you, but to be able to compare across regions they want at least one specification that examines profit per area unit (for example, acre, hectare, or square meters). 

Need to inlude graphs:
- labeled and explained graphs

Discuss results and conclusions


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Code below loads the data. 
```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
